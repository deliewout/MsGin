# MsGin
This a game engine made for the programming 4 course in Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) at Howest, filled with the patterns I've seen in class. I had to make a basic arcade game, in this case MsPacman hence the name MsGin, to prove that my engine is sufficient enough to be used as a simple game engine.

# Patterns and techniques
The patterns used in the game engine are:
- Game Loop
- Update Method
- Component
- Dirty Flag
- Command
- Observer
- Singleton
- Service Locator
- State
  
There are also 2 techniques that i used:
- MultiThreading
- Pimpl
